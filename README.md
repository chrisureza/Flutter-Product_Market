# Flutter Product Market

These is a Flutter project that simulates a market where you can upload products, add them a price, etc. So other users can see what items are available. It implements the BLOC Pattern to manager the streams with RxDart, it does CRUD operations to a Firebase datastore, it uses the devices camera and image gallery to upload the images and implements user authentication with tokens and API calls to Firebase.

## Getting Started

This Project is based on an example made by Fernando Herrera in this course (https://fernando-herrera.com/#/curso/flutter), however the version in this repo is different from the one it is based, the code is structured differently and have some new improvements made by myself.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
